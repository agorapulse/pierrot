= Usage

Pierrot provides various command to batch-manipulate code in the GitHub repositories. You can see the list
of available commands when you run the `pierrot` command without any parameters:

[source,bash]
----
include::{root-dir}/apps/pierrot/src/test/resources/com/agorapulse/pierrot/cli/PierrotCommandSpec/help.txt[]
----

Pierrot requires being authenticated to GitHub. You can either set up `GITHUB_TOKEN` or pass the token as `--github-token` parameter.
Alternatively, see other authentication options in https://github-api.kohsuke.org[the GitHub API for Java documentation].

All the commands are based on https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax[GitHub search syntax].
Pierrot works the best if you constrain the searches to an organization. If you don't want to add `org:myorg` search
term to every command then set `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION` environment variable to the name of your organization.
